In the fields of psychology and neuroscience, often researchers seek to study the effect of mood and emotion on measurable characteristics -- such as health, willingness to take risks, and other behaviors. In order to conduct this kind of research, scientists turn to movie and video clips to induce particular emotions in their viewers. However, this can prove difficult since video clips that are studied and curated are spread across a large number of paper publications in different journals.

EmotionsNet is a modern platform that aims to modernize and streamlize this process, addressing the data scarcity problem faced by researchers. By allowing everyday participants to share their emotions before and after watching a video clip, we are able to quantify the emotional impact of a video.

EmotionsNet aims to create a large database of video clips and their associated emotions. This helps both researchers in need of data as well as contributors wondering how their emotional responses compare to the general population.
